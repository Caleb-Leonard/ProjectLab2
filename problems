Line 79 : Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should.

Most likely there is nothing wrong with this. I just wanted to remind you that you can't access the global variable like this. If you knew it then please ignore the warning.
If you don't want to see this reminder in the future, then add "redefined-outer-name" (without quotes) into "Tools → Options → Assistant → Disabled checks".
